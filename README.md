# FriendFinder

created by Cera Smart

A compatibility-based "FriendFinder-like" application. This full-stack mobile-responsive site takes in results from a quiz, then compares the answers with those from a prepopulated array of the seven dwarfs. The app will then calculate the best match to the user's responses and display the name and picture of that dwarf.

Heroku deployed app: https://friend-finder-class.herokuapp.com/

How You Can Get Started With This Project
To use the app:

Simply go to the Heroku link above and click on the "Start Quiz" button at the bottom of the home page.

Why the Project is Useful
The app fulfills a homework assignment for University of Kansas Coding Boot Camp, August 2019 to February 2020. Besides allowing me to continue working with Node.js and npm packages, the assignment also allowed me to work with express and api routes.
